## Installation
To install the package, run:
```bash
go get github.com/go-zoox/password-hashing
```

## Getting Started

```go
import (
  "testing"
  "github.com/go-zoox/password-hashing"
)

func main(t *testing.T) {
	password := "the-real-password"
	// generate a hash
	hash, err := Generate(password)
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic("Failed to generate hash")
	}

	// compare hash with password
	isValid, err := Compare(hash, password)
	if err != nil {
		log.Panic("Failed to compare hash")
	}

	if !isValid {
		log.Panic("Hash is not valid")
	}
}
```
